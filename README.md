# CyberStart-Euclidean Distance

### Description
This Python project calculates the minimum Euclidean distance between points in a 2D space using the Euclidean distance formula. The program iterates through all pairs of points in a list, computes their distances, and identifies the shortest distance.

### Features
Computes the Euclidean distance for all point pairs in a given list.
Finds and displays the minimum distance and the corresponding pair of points.
** Euclidean Distance Formula: **
$$
d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
$$
